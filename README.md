# First Project from the course Intro to Digital Arts & Sciences (CAP3027)

## Java GUI Application: The Random Walk Algorithm

### To test this code, follow these steps:
* download the Processing software from Processing.org
* run the Processing application and click Sketch > Import Library > Add Library
* type "controlP5" in the search bar to find the controlP5 library
* import this library
* open Project1/RandomWalk/RandomWalk.pde in the Processing application
* click the play button to run the program
* you should see the GUI appear
* the "start" button starts the walking algorithm
* the top slider controls the maximum number of steps the program can take before it ends
* the bottom slider controls how many steps to draw on the UI upon calling draw()
* if the top check box is on, the color used the draw each step will change depending on how many steps have elapsed
* if the top check box is off, one color will be used for all steps
* if the bottom check box is on, the steps will be generated and then drawn a few at a time (the number depends on the bottom slider)
* if the bottom check box is off, the steps will be generated all at once, then drawn all at once (the bottom slider will be ignored)
